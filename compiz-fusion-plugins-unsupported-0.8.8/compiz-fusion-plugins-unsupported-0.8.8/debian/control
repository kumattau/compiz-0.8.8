Description: Compiz Fusion plugins - "unsupported" collection
 Compiz Fusion is the result of the re-unification of the Beryl-project
 and the community around the Compiz Window Manager. It seeks to provide
 an easy and fun-to-use windowing environment, allowing use of the
 graphics hardware to provide impressive effects, amazing speed and
 unrivalled usefulness
 .
 This package provides an extended collection of plugins, which have received
 the least amount of review and are the most likely to be problematic on your
 system.
