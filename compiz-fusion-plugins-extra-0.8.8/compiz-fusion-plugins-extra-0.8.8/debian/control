Description: Compiz Fusion plugins - extra collection
 Compiz Fusion is the result of the re-unification of the Beryl-project
 and the community around the Compiz Window Manager. It seeks to provide
 an easy and fun-to-use windowing environment, allowing use of the
 graphics hardware to provide impressive effects, amazing speed and
 unrivalled usefulness
 .
 This package provides plugins which are not as well tested and supported
 as the "main" plugins from the compiz-fusion project.
